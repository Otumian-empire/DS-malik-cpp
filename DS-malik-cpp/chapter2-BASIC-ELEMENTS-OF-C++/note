A computer program, or a program, is a sequence of
statements whose objective is to accomplish a task.

Programming is a process of planning and creating a program.

Most stand alone c++ program is of the form,
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // code
    return 0;
}

The syntax rules tell you which statements (instructions) are 
 legal, or accepted by the programming language, and which are not.

The semantic rules, which determine the meaning of the instructions.

Programming language: A set of rules, symbols, and special words.

Comment can be used to identify the authors of the program, give the
 date, when the program is written or modified, give a brief 
 explanation of the program, and explain the meaning of key statements
  in a program.
Single line Comment //
Multiline Comment /* */

Reserved keywords cannot be used for anything other than their intended
 use by the developer.

Identifiers consists of letters, digits, and the underscore character ( _ )
and must begin with a letter or underscore.

Whitespaces include blanks, tabs, and newline characters.

Data type is set of values together with a set of operations.
There are 3 types of Data types in c++:
1. Simple data type
2. Structured data type
3. Pointers

Simple Data Types
The simple data type is the fundamental data type in C++ because it becomes a building
block for the structured data type. There are three categories of simple data:
1. Integers
2. Floating-point
3. Enumeration (user-defined data type)

Arithmetic Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction or negation), * (multiplication), /
(division), % (mod, (modulus or remainder)).
Precedence: * , /, %, +, -

implicit type coercion is when a value of one data type is automatically changed to another
data type.
explicit type conversion/casting is done, static_cast<dataTypeName>(expression) or 
dataType(expression) .
Eg: static_cast<int>(1.2) or int(1.2)

The data type string is a programmer-defined data type.
A string is a sequence of zero or more characters.

Storing data in the computer’s memory is a two-step process:
1. Instruct the computer to allocate memory.
2. Include statements in the program to put data into the allocated memory.

Named constant is a memory location whose content is not allowed to change during
program execution.
Eg: const dataType identifier = value;

Variable is a memory location whose content may change during program execution.
Eg: dataType identifier, identifier, ...;

you must declare all identifiers before you can use them.

you can place data into a variable in two ways:
1. Use C++’s assignment statement.
2. Use input (read) statements.
Eg: variable = expression;

When a variable is declared, memory is allocated for it.

Putting data into variables from the standard input device is accomplished via the use of
cin and the operator >> . The syntax of cin together with >> is:
cin >> variable >> variable ...;
>> is called the stream extraction operator.

Suppose count is an int variable. The statement:
count = count + 1;
count += 1;
count++;
increments the value of count by 1.

Pre-increment: ++variable
Post-increment: variable++

Pre-decrement: ––variable
Post-decrement: variable––

output on the standard output device is accomplished via the use of cout and
the operator << . The general syntax of cout together with << is:
cout << expression or manipulator << expression or manipulator...;
<< is called the stream insertion operator

Generating output with cout follows two rules:
1. The expression is evaluated, and its value is printed at the current
insertion point on the output device.
2. A manipulator is used to format the output. The simplest manipulator
is endl (the last character is the letter el), which causes the insertion
point to move to the beginning of the next line.

\ is called the escape character and \n is called newline escape sequence.

reprocessor directives are processed by a program called a preprocessor.
#include <headerFileName>

cin, cout and endl identifiers are declared in the header file iostream , but within
the std namespace. use std::cin, std::cout, std::endl with `using namespace std;`

#include <string> to use the string dataType

Program Style and Form:
1. A C++ program must contain the function main
2. Every line of expression/statement must end with ;
3. By conversion variable names are lowercase where constants are Uppercase
4. Use clearly written prompts so that users will know what to do when they interact
 with a program
5. use comments to document programs. They should appear in a program to explain the
 purpose of the program, identify who wrote it, and explain the purpose of particular
  statements.

variable = variable operations (expression);
can written as:
variable operations= expression;
