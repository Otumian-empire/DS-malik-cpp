/* Newtonâ€™s law states that the force, F, between two bodies of masses P and
Q is given by:
    F = k (P*Q)/d^2
in which k is the gravitational constant and d is the distance between the
bodies. The value of k is approximately 6.67E-8 dyn. cm^2 /g^2 . Write a program that
prompts the user to input the masses of the bodies and the
distance between the bodies. The program then outputs the force between
the bodies.*/
