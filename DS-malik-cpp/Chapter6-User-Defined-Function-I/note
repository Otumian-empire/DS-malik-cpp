Functions are often called modules.

User-defined functions in C++ are classified into two categories:
    Value-returning functions—functions that have a return type. These
     functions return a value of a specific data type using the return
     statement, which we will explain shortly.
    Void functions—functions that do not have a return type. These
     functions do not use a return statement to return a value.

Formal Parameter: A variable declared in the function heading.
Actual Parameter: A variable or expression listed in a call to a function.

Function Prototype: The function heading without the body of the function.

The general syntax of the function prototype of a value-returning function is:
functionType functionName(parameter list);
