/*Write a program that takes as input any change expressed in cents. 
It should then compute the number of half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to be returned, 
returning as many half-dollars as possible, then quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, in that order. For 
example, 483 cents should be returned as 9 halfdollars, 1 quarter, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies.
