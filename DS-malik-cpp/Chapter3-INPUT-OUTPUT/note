In C++, I/O is a sequence of bytes, called a stream, from the source to the
destination.

Therefore, a stream is a sequence of characters from the source to the destination.
There are two types of streams:
1. Input stream: A sequence of characters from an input device to the computer.
2. Output stream: A sequence of characters from the computer to an output device.

To use cin and cout , every C++ program must use the preprocessor directive:
#include <iostream>

Use some predefined functions from cmath lib such as pow, sqrt

The variable cin can access the stream function get , which is used to read character
data. cin.get(varChar);

use the stream function ignore to discard a portion of the input.
cin.ignore(intExp, chExp); This will ignore the next intExp characters or until it 
 encounters chExp. cin.ignore(); with no args skips the very next char

when wrong value is supplied to the input stream, the I/O enters into a fail state
use the stream function clear to restore the input stream to a
working state, istreamVar.clear();

endl, setprecision(n) , fixed , showpoint , setfill(ch) setw(n), left, right and getline(cin, strVar) are 
manipulator is used to format the output.

To use the manipulator setprecision , the program must include the header file
iomanip . Thus, the following include statement is required:
#include <iomanip>

File: An area in secondary storage used to hold information.
C++ provides a header file called fstream , which is used for file I/O.
File I/O is a five-step process:
1. Include the header file fstream in the program.
2. Declare file stream variables.
3. Associate the file stream variables with the input/output sources.
4. Use the file stream variables with >> , << , or other input/output functions.
5. Close the files.
